# Facial_keypoints

Hi,

This is my submission for Coursera's Deep Learning in Computer Vision week 2 peer-graded assigment 'Facial keypoints detection'.

In this assignment I train a convolutional neural network to recognise 14 keypoints from faces. The dataset consists of 6000 images with corresponding keypoints. A simple horizontal flip is created as data augmentation. However, flipping and swapping also the points was an interesting and relatively challenging problem, but I managed to solve it.

Please contact me if you have any questions!

Best regards,

Tuomas Jalonen
